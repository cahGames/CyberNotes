<ins>Googling</ins>: fundamental skill of a hacker

- if we google something between quotation marks, google will interpret that as exact and only return the results of the the exact phrase provided
- Google Dorking:
    - if we insert `site:` before our research, Google returns with fewer results, and it's more likely that we find the website we were looking for
    - `filetype:` search for a file by its extension
    - `cache:` view google's cached version of a specified url
    - `intitle:` the phrase must appear in the title of the page. DANGEROUS NOTE: if you search for `intitle:index.of` you may see endpoints that should probably be hidden. Clicking on the results is discouraged :)
